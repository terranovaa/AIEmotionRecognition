# Emotion Recognition
The purpose of this project is to classify emotions using Machine Learning techniques starting from data obtained through a network of non-invasive wearable sensors.<br>

The physiological signals of an individual, such as heart rate, skin conductance response, muscle electrical activity, and brain electrical signals, are strongly linked to their emotional state. The objective of this project is to use these metrics to create an AI capable of recognizing the user's emotional state.<br>
More details and the results of the analysis are included in the documentation file.<br>
